# My LeetCode Solutions
 This repository contains my solutions to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) problems.

## What I've learned:
* Don't rush to use *for loop* (brute force). Think about improving the solution not only answering it.
* Check discussions and compare your solution with others' solutions.
* Try to think about the performance. You should think of solving the problem with the most efficient solution.
* How simple is to write a solution code with high memory usage! Care about memory. It's not always available enough!
