# My LeetCode Solutions
 This repository contains my solutions to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) problems. In this journey I'm trying to improve my problem solving skills. The solutions are the simplest not necessarily the most efficient. I hope I learn a lot in this journey, transfer learning to the next problems, and get back to the previous solutions in order to make them more efficient. 

## ✍️ What I've already learned:
* Don't rush to use *for loop* (brute force). Think about improving the solution not only answering it.
* Check discussions and compare your solution with others' solutions.
* Try to think about the performance. You should think of solving the problem with the most efficient solution.
* How simple is to write a solution code with high memory usage! Care about memory. It's not always available enough! 
* Try to find new solutions that they don't come to mind in the first look. This way new paths will activate in your mind.
* There are some nice and smart solutions for a simple problem that you can't even think of it!
* Consider the real life situations as an important parameter when you're choosing the best solution among some possible solutions.
* Beware of border cases!
* A timely and accurate return/exit will save a lot of execution time.
